# My Build of ST, the dynamic window manager

This is my build of the suckless terminal (st), from suckless.org.

It is a minimalist terminal written mostly in C. All configuration is done by editing the source code directly, which is often done by applying 'patches' that others have written. 

See the website for a download and more info. 

Feel free to take anything you find useful.
